# ML OOPS with NumPy

This repository contains machine learning concepts implemented from scratch using Python, NumPy, and Object-Oriented Programming.

### Topics Covered
- Feature Scaling (Normalization & Standardization)
- Core OOP concepts for ML
- Vectorized operations with NumPy
### OOP Basics
- employee.py → Employee class example
- developer.py → Inheritance and method overriding
- manager.py → Manager class example

### ML Concepts
- simple_linear_model.py → Simple linear prediction
- other ML utilities → Normalization, axis operations, summaries

### Utilities
- dataset_handler.py → Row/column operations
- misc_examples.py → Python + NumPy examples

## Notes
- Implemented using NumPy (vectorization)
- Focused on first-year friendly ML concepts
- Designed for **learning and interviews**
